## Two player Dice Game
#### I have built a two player Dice Hame using HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript which will be played in DOM.

#### Functionality: This game has two functions. The landing screen shows two buttons: "Roll the Dice" and "Edit Names"

**Edit Names:** Allows users to input their names through an Alert Prompt

**Roll the Dice:** You start the game by clicking this button.

#### Dice game rules: Two players roll the dice and the dice with the highest number would win the round. If both the dice have the same number, it would be a draw. The rounds are continued until a player wins a total of 5 rounds to be declared a winner. Once a winner is declared, there will be an option to restart the game via a button prompt.

### Technologies used for Dice Game

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Javascript

### Future Improvements:

Dice Game in which a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 20 or more points wins.
