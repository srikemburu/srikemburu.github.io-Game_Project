## Two player Dice Game
#### I have built a two player Dice Hame with HTML, CSS, JavaScript which will be played in DOM.

#### Functionality: This game has two functions. The landing screen shows two buttons: "Roll thr Dice" and "Edit Names"

1. **Edit Names: ** Allows users to input their names through an Alert Prompt
2. **Roll the Dice: ** You start the game by clicking this button.

#### Dice game rules: Two players roll the dice and the dice with the highest number would win the round. If both the dice have the same number, it would be a draw. The rounds are continued until a player wins a total of 5 rounds to be declared a winner. Once a winner is declared, there will be an option to restart the game via a button prompt.
